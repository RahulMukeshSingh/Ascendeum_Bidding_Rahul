Part 1: Describe how you would build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a bid winning (win) based on the other columns. What features would you select and why?
Part 2: Based on the following results from a logistic regression model  trained on the dataset, interpret the coefficients:
bid_amount: Coefficient = 0.8
time_to_bid: Coefficient = -0.4
ad_unit_A: Coefficient = 0.3 (reference category: ad_unit_B)

-------------------------
Part 1: Ans]
Logistic Regression Steps:
1. Binary Classes for Target Variable using Threshold.
2. Removing irredundant columns based on domain knowledge and sparse data, Cleaning of data and Sanity Checks.
3. Feature Engineering and Derived Metrics
4. Select Features based on good correlations with target variable
5. Train and Test Split based on 80:20 ratio and I will Stratify the split based on Target Class Imbalance.
6. Preprocessing Pipelines: Categorical Columns: Impute and OneHotEncoding. Numerical Columns: Impute (median) and Standard Scaling.
7. VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) check: To manually remove features till VIF <= 5 and based on Domain Knowledge to avoid multicolinearity.
8. RFE (Recursive Feature Elimination) to reduce features to let's say to 10 features.
9. After that, Logistic Model with regularization where L1: Lasso (to reduce features) and L2: Ridge (to reduce dominance)
10. Apply transformation on test dataset as well and predict the values.
11. Evaluate the prediction with ROC AUC Curve, Confusion Matrix, Precision and Recall.
12. Evaluate the coefficient (Log Odds) to determine business decisions.

Feature Selection:
1. ad_unit: to understand which ad placement results to more bid wins.
2. bid_range: Guess would be higher bid amount results to more bid wins.
3. date_hour (Derived Column: Time and Date): which date or time, the bid win chances are more.
4. sum_time_to_respond: This metric is crucial to avoid timeouts in bids. Assumption is faster respond leads to more bid wins.
5. bidder: Is there any correlation between Bidder and Target Variable
6. Win rate: Target Variable in Binary Classes.

-------------------------
Part 2: Ans]

bid_amount: Coefficient = 0.8
time_to_bid: Coefficient = -0.4
ad_unit_A: Coefficient = 0.3 (reference category: ad_unit_B)


Odd Ratio - bid_amount: 2.23
Odd Ratio - time_to_bid: 0.67
Odd Ratio - ad_unit_A: (reference category: ad_unit_B) 1.35

If every features remain constant:
2.1] Positive Correlation: With every more unit of bid amount, there is very high chances of winning a bid with log odds of 0.8 
i.e. odds of winning increases (almost doubles) by 123%. ((exp(0.8) - 1) * 100 = 100* (2.23 - 1) = 123%)
2.2] Negative Correlation: With every delay in time_to_bid, there is very low chances of winning a bid with log odds of -0.4
i.e. odds of winning decreases by 33%. ((exp(-0.4) - 1) * 100 = 100* (0.67 - 1) = -33%)
2.3] Positive Correlation: With every more add placement of Unit A compared to Unit B, 
there is very high chances of winning a bid with log odds of 0.3 
i.e. odds of winning increases by 35%. ((exp(0.3) - 1) * 100 = 100* (1.35 - 1) = 35%)

Effect on Winning Bid (sorted from high influence to low):
1. Bid Amount (+ve correlation)
2. time_to_bid (-ve correlation)
3. ad_unit_A compared to ad_unit_B (+ve correlation)
